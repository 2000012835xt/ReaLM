Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so she can download 200 GB/100 minutes = 2 GB/minute * 100 minutes = 200 GB
But 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.
So Carla downloaded 200 GB - 200 * 40% = 200 * 0.6 = 120 GB
Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.
So it takes 200 GB - 120 GB = 80 GB to download the file.
The answer is

John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he drove 60 * 3 = 180 miles.
Then he turned around and drove for 4 hours, but he spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he drove 4 - 2 = 2 hours at a speed of 30 mph, so he drove 30 * 2 = 60 miles.
Then he drove for the remaining half-hour at a speed of 80 mph, so he drove 80 * 0.5 = 40 miles.
So he drove 180 + 60 + 40 =

Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.
So she eats 3 eggs every morning.
She eats 3 eggs for 4 weeks.
So she eats 3 * 4 = 12 eggs in 4 weeks.
So she eats 12 / 6 = 2 eggs in a week.
So she eats 2 * 12 = 24 eggs in a month.
So she eats 24 / 12 = 2 eggs in a week.
So she eats 2 * 4 = 8 eggs in a week.
So she eats 8 / 6 = 1.3

Marissa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed was 4 miles / 1 hour = 4 miles per hour.
She walked 2 miles in 1 hour, so her speed was 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour.
The total distance she walked is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.
The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.
To have an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance in 6 / 4 = 1.5 hours.
Her speed is 6 / 1.5 = 4 miles per hour.

Let the price of the boots be x dollars
The price of the first pair of heels is 33 dollars
The price of the second pair of heels is 2x dollars
The total price of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 2x dollars
The total price of the boots and the two pairs of heels is x + 33 + 2x = 3x + 33 dollars
The total price of the boots and the two pairs of heels is 5 dollars less than the price of the boots, so 3x + 33 - 5 = x
3x + 28 = x
3x = 28
x = 28/3

The selling price of the house is $350 000
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350 000 = $17 500
The transfer fee is 12% of $350 000 = $42 000
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17 500 + $42 000 = $409 500
The difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409 500 - $400 000 = $9 500
9 9500
The selling price of the house is 400 000
The transfer fees are 3% of 400 000 = 12 000
The brokerage fee is 5% of 400 000 = 20 000
The remaining loan amount is 250 000
The net proceeds from selling the house are 400 000 - 12 000 - 20 000 - 250 000 = 50 000
The answer is 50000
50000 118000
It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
It takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.

After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
So it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.
The answer is 23

Let's call the smallest group A, and the other two groups B and C.
Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, then A = B - 10 and A = C - 10.
Adding the two equations, we get 2A = B + C - 20.
Since the total number of students is 200, then B + C = 200.
Substituting B + C = 200 into 2A = B + C - 20, we get 2A = 200 - 20, or A = 90.
The answer is 9

Tom traveled 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers during the first 4 days.
He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, which is 30% of 800 = 240 kilometers during the next two days.
He didn't travel at all on the next day.
During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day.
So, he traveled 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers during the second week.
Thus, he traveled 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140

The power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
So the power bank was losing 9% * 5 = 45% of the total capacity.
The power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
So the power bank was losing 7% * 3 = 21% of the total capacity.
The power bank was losing 45% + 21% = 66% of the total capacity.
The power bank was losing 100% - 66% = 34% of the total capacity.
The power bank was losing 34% * 28

Abraham sold half of the land for $50, so 80/2 = 40 square meters for $50.
So he sold 40 square meters for $50/40 = $1.25 per square meter.
After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30, so 80/4 = 20 square meters for $30.
So he sold 20 square meters for $30/20 = $1.50 per square meter.
He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter.
So he sold 80 - 40 - 20 = 2

Randy has 9 - 3 = 6 oatmeal cookies, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 - 2 = 3 sugar cookies.
He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he has 6 - 2 = 4 oatmeal cookies.
He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 sugar cookie.
He baked 4 of each flavor for dinner, so he has 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.
So, he has 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies now

Nate's dog can dig 6 holes a day.
He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation.
So he dug 6 * 14 = 84 holes.
When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day.
The dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night.
So Nate fills in 9 holes a day and the dog digs 6 holes a day.
So Nate fills in 9 - 6 = 3 holes a day more than the dog digs.
So it takes him 84 / 3 = 28 days to fill in all the holes.
The answer is 
[invalid] 4

Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, and to place them all on the lab bench.
Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
So Igor gathered 16/2 = 8 test tubes, 7 + 2 = 9 beakers, and 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
In total, the number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 8 + 9 + 16 = 33.
Since the total number of items Igor had placed on

Each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws.
So, 4 tables have 4 * 4 = 16 legs and each leg needs 2 screws.
So, 16 legs need 16 * 2 = 32 screws.
James has 40 screws.
So, he has 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.
The answer is 8

Alexandra raised $430
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $400 + $300 = $700
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750
The total amount raised by all the girls is $430 + $700 + $750 = $1880
The answer is 1880
1880 2280
Vanessa ran 4 miles, so she ran 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles in the same time as Aaron ran 1 mile.
Aaron ran 1 mile in 16 minutes, so he ran 1 mile / 2 = 0.5 miles in 8 minutes.
Vanessa ran 2 miles in 8 minutes, so she ran 1 mile in 4 minutes.
The answer is 4

The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
So he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line.
He has 6 feet of new line.
So he needs 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.
The answer is 594
594 594
Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
So they make 6 * 2 * 5 + 6 * 5 = 60 + 30 = 90 dollars a night.
If they are open 2 days a week, they make 90 * 2 = 180 dollars a week.
The answer is 180
180 180
The total profit of the fruit vendor is 25% of 50 watermelons, which is 50 * 25% = 12.5 watermelons.
The total profit is 12.5 * 80 = $1000.
The total cost of the watermelons is 50 * 80 = $4000.
The total profit is the difference between the total cost and the total profit, which is 4000 - 1000 = 3000.
The total cost of each watermelon is 3000 / 50 = $60.
The total profit of

James is 12 years old now, so he was born 12 years ago.
James is twice as old as Dora, so Dora is 6 years old now.
Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she will be 15 years old in 3 years.
John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is 32 - 12 = 20 years old now.
In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 20 + 3 = 23 years old.
The answer is 23

The cost for a new radiator is $400
He gets it for 80% off, so he pays 400 * 0.2 = 80
He hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour, so he pays 50 * 3 = 150
So he pays 80 + 150 = 230
The answer is 230

Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
She saw 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours.
She saw two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours.
She saw every bee that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive in the next 6 hours.
So, she saw 30 + 1/2 * 30 + 2 * 30 + 30 = 130 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

The total price of the large stuffed animals sold is 12 * x.
The total price of the small stuffed animals sold is 4 * 2x.
The total price of the stuffed animals sold is 12x + 8x = 20x.
The total price of the stuffed animals sold is $120, so 20x = 120

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so 1/5 of the jellyfish are large.
A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so 1/5 * 1/3 of the jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so 4/5 of the jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color, so 6 jellyfish are large and change color from green to blue under UV light.
So, 1/5 * 1/3 + 6 = 1

Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, so Colin will be 1/5 of Wendy's age seven years from now.
In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so Colin will be 1/3 of Wendy's age in 25 years.
Since Colin will be 1/5 of Wendy's age seven years from now, and 1/3 of Wendy's age in 25 years, Colin will be 1/5 * 7 + 1/3 * 25 = 14 + 25/3 = 14 + 8.

Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg, so she sells 9 * 2 = $18 worth of eggs.
The answer is 18

The value of the house increased by 150%, so the new value of the house is 150% of 80000 = 120000
So the profit is 120000 - 80000 - 50000 = 30000
The answer is 30000

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning.
She gives them 25 cups of feed in the afternoon.
So in total, she gives them 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.
She gives them 40 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.
The answer is 40

The first glass costs $5, the second glass costs 60% of $5 = $3, the third glass costs 60% of $3 = $1.8, the fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8 = $1.08, and so on.
The total cost of the 16 glasses is $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + ... + $0.000000000000000000000000 Rapidly approaching $0.00000000000000000000000

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * Charleston's sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * Seattle's sheep.
Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together 2 * Charleston's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Seattle's sheep = 3 * Charleston's sheep + Seattle's sheep.
Seattle has 20 sheep, so Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together 3 * Charleston's sheep + 20 = 3 * Charleston's sheep + 20 = 3 * (4

Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so she can download 200 GB/100 minutes = 2 GB/minute * 100 minutes = 200 GB
But 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.
So Carla downloaded 200 GB - 200 * 40% = 200 * 0.6 = 120 GB
Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.
So she downloaded 120 GB + 120 GB = 240 GB
The answer is 24

John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he drove 60 * 3 = 180 miles.
Then he turned around and drove for 4 hours, but he spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he drove 4 - 2 = 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph.
So he drove 80 * 2 = 160 miles.
Thus, he is 180 + 160 = 340 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.
The answer is 340
340 45
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10
So her overtime pay is 1.2 * $10 = $12
So her total earnings for 45 hours are 40 * $10 + 5 * $12 = $400 + $60 = $460
The answer is 460

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it had 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.
In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so it had 180 * 0.7 = 126 downloads.
So the program had 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads total over the three months.
The answer is 366
366 366
The total cost of the donuts is 3 * 68 = 204
The total cost of the mini cupcakes is 2 * 80 = 160
The total cost of the mini cheesecakes is 6 * 55 = 330
The total cost of the pastries is 204 + 160 + 330 = 794
The answer is 794
794 694
The tree will cost $90 to plant.
Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each.
It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.
So, the total cost of the tree is $90 + 3 * 7 = $90 + $21 = $111
The total profit of the tree is 7 * 1.5 = 10.5
So, the tree will start earning money after 111/10.5 = 10.6 years
The answer is 10.6

Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had 1/3 * 5 = 5/3 vacuum cleaners left.
She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had 5/3 + 2 = 11/3 vacuum cleaners left.
She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she had 11/3 / 2 = 11/6 vacuum cleaners left.
She had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so she started with 5 + 5/3 + 2 + 11/6 = 16 vacuum cleaners.
The answer is
[invalid] 18
The total number of students is 20.
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, so 20% of 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.
25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, so 25% of 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

So, the population of Chile six years ago was 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 of the current population.
Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
So, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, then the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 40 = 120000.
The current population of Chile is 12
120000 120000
There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense.
So, the number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense.
There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.
So, the number of players on the special teams is 1/2 times the number of players on the defense.
The total number of players is 105.
So, the number of players on the defense is 105 / (2 + 1/2) = 105 / 2.5 = 42.
The answer is 42

Let's call the smallest group A, and the other two groups B and C.
Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, we have:
A + B = C + 10
A + C = B + 10
A + B + C = 200
We can solve the system of equations:
A + B = C + 10
A + C = B + 10
A + B + C = 200
A + B + C = 200
A + B = C + 10
A + C = B + 10
A + B + C = 20

The original price of the book is represented by 100%.
The discount is represented by 25%.
So, 100% - 25% = 75% is the price of the book after the discount.
So, 75% * 19.50 = 14.625 is the price of the book after the discount.
So, 19.50 / 14.625 = 1.34 is the ratio of the original price to the price of the book after the discount.
So, 1.34 * 19.50 = 26.59 is the original price

Since Peter has more chocolate bars than Martha, then x > y
Dividing both sides by x, we get 4 > 7 * y / x
Dividing both sides by 7, we get 4 / 7 > y / x
Multiplying both sides by x, we get 4x / 7 > y
Dividing both sides by 4, we get x /

Kim raises $320 more than Andra, so Kim raises $320 + $430 = $750
Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $400 + $300 = $700
So the girls raised $750 + $700 = $1450 in total
The answer is 1450
1450 2280
Vanessa ran 4 miles, so she ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles in 16 minutes.
Aaron ran 2 miles, so he ran 2 / 2 = 1 mile in 16 minutes.
Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so she ran 2 * 1 = 2 miles in 16 minutes.
The answer is 16

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
So they make 6 * 2 * 5 + 6 * 5 = 60 + 30 = 90 dollars a night.
So they make 90 * aman * 2 = 90 * 2 = 180 dollars a week.
The answer is 180

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80
So the price of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.6
He sold all of them at a profit of 25%
So the price of each watermelon is $1 Whose 25% is $1.6
So the price of each watermelon iselly is $1.6 * 1.25 = $2
The answer is 2

When John was 19, he had a son James.
When John was 32, he had a son.
So, John's youngest son is 32 - 19 = 13 years old.
James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years.
So, James is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.
So, John's youngest son will be 13 + 3 = 16 years old in 3 years.
The answer is 16

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so she peels 1 orange in 3 minutes.
Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so she peels 1 orange in 4 minutes.
Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, so they peel 1 orange in 3 minutes and 1 orange in 4 minutes.
After an hour, Ana and Jane peel 1 orange in 3 minutes and 1 orange in 4 minutes for 60 minutes.
Ana peels 60 / 3 = 20 oranges, and Jane peels 60 / 4 = 
20 5
The cost for a new radiator is $400
He gets it at 100% off = $400 * 100% = $400
He hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour
So he pays $50 * 3 = $150
So he pays
The answer is 550
550 230
Since the total number of legs is 70, the number of legs of chickens is 70/2 = 35.
