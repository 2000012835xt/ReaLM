Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored 20 + Azibo = 20 + x
Dinar scored 10 more than Azibo, so Dinar scored 10 + Azibo = 10 + x
Adding the scores of Bahati and Dinar, we get 20 + x + 10 + x = 30 neglecting the x's
30 + x = 45
x = 45 - 30 = 15
Azibo scored 15 points

The total number of legs is represented by 70
So, 20 * 4 superscript + x = 70
ardi
Solving for x, we get x = 70 - 20 * 4 superscript = 70 - 80 = -10
The answer is -10
-10 5
Henry andса and his friends have 7 pizzas.
Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
So they have 7 *  8 = 56 slices.
