Let's assume that Sam is x years old now.
Ruby is 6x years old.
In 9 years, Ruby will be 6x + 9 years old.
► Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Isaias has to sell 3/5 of the chickens he took to the market for sale.
So, 3/5 of the chickens he took to the market for sale is 300 * 3/5 = 180 chickens.
If he sells 180 chickens at $50 per chicken, he will make a profit of $50 * 180 = $9000.
Since he has to make a profit of $2000, he has to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale at $9000 - $2000 = $7000.
