The selling price of the house is $350 000
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5% * $350 000 = $17 500
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 12% * $350 000 = $42 000
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17 500 + $42 000 = $409 500
The total price of the house is $409 500 - $400
409 9500
The selling price of the house is $400 000
The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, so 3% of $400 000 = $12 000
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, so 5% of $400 000 = $20 000
The remaining loan amount of the house is $250 000
The net proceeds from selling the house is $400 000 - $12 000 - $20 000 - $250 000 = $35 0

2x + z = 90
z = 90 - 2x
We can substitute z with 90 - 2x in the first equation:
x + x + 90 - 2x + z = 100

Let's assume that Teresa sold x large stuffed animals and 2x small stuffed animals.
The price of each large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of each small stuffed animal, so the price of each large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = 12.
The price of each small stuffed animal is 4.
The total revenue from the sales is 12 * x + 4 * 2x = 12x + 8x = 20x.
Since the total revenue is $12 Vere, 20x = 120.
So x = 120 / 20 = 6.

The regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
The special size box has 20% more pods, so the number of pods in the special size box is 100 + 20% = 120.
The special size box costs the same as the regular box, so the cost of the special size box is $12.
The cost of the special size box per pod is $12 / 120 = $0.10.
If you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 100 cycles for $1.
The answer is 100

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.
He loses 10 bills while getting home.
So he has 1000 - 10 = 990 bills.

So he has 990 / 2 = 495 bills.
He triples his money.
So he has 495 * 3 = 1485 bills.
He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
So he has 1485 / 5 = 297 bills.
