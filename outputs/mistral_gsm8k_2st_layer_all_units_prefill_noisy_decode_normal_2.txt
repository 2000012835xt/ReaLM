The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so in 42 days they produce 42 * 3 = 126 eggs.
The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so in 42 days they produce 42 * 5 = 210 eggs.
The total number of eggs produced by the chickens is 126 + 210 = 336 eggs.
Since the white chickens produce more eggs than the red chickens, the number of white chickens is greater than the number of red chickens.
The number of white chickens is 210 / 5 = 42, and the number of red chick

Sally found 8 blue balloons, and 75% of them were added to her remaining balloons, so 8 * 75% = 6 blue balloons were added.
So Sally carried 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow

Wendy is 5 times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, so Colin will be 5/7 of Wendy's age seven years from now.
In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so Colin will be 1/3 of Wendy's age in 25 years.
Since Colin will be 5/7 of Wendy's age seven years from now, and 1/3 of Wendy's age in 25 years, Colin will be 5/7 * 1/3 = 5/21 of Wendy's age in 18 years.
