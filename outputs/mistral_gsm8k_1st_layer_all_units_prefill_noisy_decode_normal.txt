Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so she can download 200 GB/100 minutes = 2 GB/minute * 100 minutes = 200 GB in 100 minutes
But 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.
So Carla downloaded 200 GB * 40% = 80 GB in 80 minutes
Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.
So she downloaded 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB in 20 minutes
So it takes 120

Sara earns $5 * 4 = $20 babysitting the neighbor's kids.
She earns $4 * 3 = $12 mowing the lawn.
She already had $10 saved.
So she has $20 + $12 + $10 = $42.
The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20.
So she needs $30 + 2 * $20 = $70 to buy the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.
She needs $70 - $42 = $28 more to buy the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.
So she needs to mow the lawn

So John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday and 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John earned 4 * 10 = 40 dollars on Saturday and 3 * 10 = 30 dollars on Sunday.
So John earned 40 + 30 = 70 dollars more than Jill.

40% of the red balloons burst, so 40% of 25 = 10 red balloons burst.
Half of the yellow balloons were released, so 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons were released.
Sally found 8 blue balloons, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, so 8 * 75% = 6 blue balloons were added.
So Sally carried 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons,

Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
So he paid $4000 * 3.5 = $14,000
2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold.
So 2/5 of 4000 = 800 gallons of milk could not be sold.
The refund he got is $14,000 - $3.5 * 800 = $14,000 - $2800 = $11,200

Wendy is 5 times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
So, Colin will be 1/5 of Wendy's age seven years from now.
In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
So, Colin will be 1/3 of Wendy's age in 25 years.
Since Colin will be 1/5 of Wendy's age seven years from now, and 1/3 of Wendy's age in 25 years, we can conclude that Wendy is 5/3 times as old as Colin is now.
So, Colin is 3/5 of Wendy'
